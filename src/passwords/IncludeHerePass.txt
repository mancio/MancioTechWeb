you can include here your Js file with password Handler
ex. getPass, getUser, ecc....
be careful and store only that kind of pass you can exposed because are generated from
external service and do not give access directly to sensible data.
For example in case of EmailJs, password are used to send email so in the worst case scenario
you will be just victim of spam.
